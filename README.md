# Dungeon-Maze
Assignment 2 in CMPT 213 of the SFU Computing Science Program.

# Workflow
NOTE: Due to the apparent lack of version control features in the IntelliJ IDE, we unfortunately cannot directly integrate local projects to   the Github repository, so commits and changes has to remain unautomated for the time being.

1. Always create or make changes to the corrosponding documentation in Creately before actual commit.
   (Make sure to have documentation for every single class)

2. Have a local IntelliJ project set up locally on the PC.

3. Download the object file you want to edit from this repository and use it to overwrite the same file in your local project. 
   (The latter can be found through right clicking said file and selecting "Find in Explorer" in IntelliJ)
   
4. Make changes to the file in IntelliJ

5. Delete the original file in the Github repository and re-upload the changed file in its place.

IMPORTANT: Only commit to the branch of your name, DO NOT commit directly to the master branch unless the commit has been reviewed and agreed upon by all collaborators.
